## Getting Started

As this project is designed to be a template for a Biolab activity, these instructions will have you create a new activity repo, then get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

git and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) must be installed and are assumed to be in your path.

### Installing

On your local machine, create a new activity directory (e.g.: biolab-activity-strong-vs-weak-acid-dissociation) and initialize it as a git repo:

``` 
mkdir new-activity-name
cd new-activity-name
git init
```

Pull the source from project and then initialize and fetch the configuration submodule:

```
git pull https://github.com/CMUEberlyCenter/biolab-template
git submodule update --init conf/
```

Open a browser, go to GitHub, and create a new repository for the activity (naming convention is biolab-activity-something).

Add your new repo as the origin of your local repo and push everything there:

```
git remote add origin git-url-of-new-activity-repo
git push -u origin master
```

Install dependencies from npm:

```
npm i
```

Now that the config update dependencies are installed, do a config update and another install in case anything new came from upstream:

```
npm run conf
npm i
```

To start the dev server and see a skeleton program run:

```
npm run start
```

and point your browser at the URL it tells you (probably [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080))

### Configuring hosted CI services

Biolab activities should follow the model of this template by having tested, maintainable code. Login to the following services with your GitHub credentials and enable the new activity's repository in each. The links below will take you directly to the respective add repo pages. No additional configuration is required.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories) - Continuous integration build and testing

[Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/repos/new) - Code coverage tracking

[Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/repos/new) - Code maintainability

Update the shield links in the new activity's `README.md`. The links should change from the template's project to that of the new activity's project. Finally, commit those changes and push them to GitHub.

## Developing and Building the Activity

Assuming the steps in Getting Started completed successfully, work on the activity code can begin in earnest. Most development work will be in `src/sketch.js` and will vary based on the requirements of the activity.

### Building the Activity

Build scripts within `package.json` manage the development lifecycle.

As seen above in Getting Started, `npm run start` spools up a dev server. Changes made to source files will be automatically reflected once saved. 

If it's desirable to just open an html file locally on the dev machine, you can perform a dev build:

```
npm run build:dev
```

That will build the project using the dev webpack configuration and export it to `dist/`. The exported file `dist/index.html` can be opened with a browser by doing `File > Open File...` (or equivalent.

You can automatically perform a rebuild whenever a change is made to a source file:

```
npm run build:watch
```

Just reload the `dist/index.html` file already open in your browser.

Finally, remove all files in `dist/` with:

```
npm run build:clean
```

As is typically done before a clean build.

Regenerate a production bundle before commiting changes to master:

```
npm run build:clean
npm run build # an alias for build:prod
```

In a production build, ESLint must succeed or the build will fail and no files will be in `dist/`.

### Generating documentation

Documentation uses JSDoc, and can be generated with:

```
npm run doc
```

Examples of properly documented code can be found in the template. You should regenerate documentation before commiting changes to master if any of those changes would affect the documentation.

### Deploying the demo to GitHub Pages

A publicly accessible demo of the activity can be created by the following:

```
npm run deploy
```

The demo will be located at [https://cmueberlycenter.github.io/biolab-activity-name](https://cmueberlycenter.github.io/biolab-activity-name). If it's not found, check the GitHub Pages settings for the repository. Ensure it is turned on and set to use the `gh-pages` branch.

### Receiving upstream configuration changes

The [biolab-config](https://github.com/CMUEberlyCenter/biolab-config) project governs how activities should generally be configured and it's a good idea to regularly pull those updates. The one-stop shop to fetch updates and incorporate those changes is:

```
npm run conf
```

Upstream configuration is included as a submodule and placed in `conf/`. All activity-specific configuration overrides should be done by editing the appropriate file(s) in the project root, and NOT by editing files within `conf/`. Configuration overrides in files at the project root take precedence and will not be overwritten. This includes edits to the `package.json` file: It is carefully merged with the upstream `package-base.json` and additional, activity-specific packages can be installed using `npm i <package-name> --save-dev` or `npm i <package-name> --save` as normal.

## Running Tests

Test scripts are included in the `package.json` file. Tests discussed below should all pass before getting committed. When a commit is pushed to master on GitHub, Code Climate and Travis CI are automatically triggered. Code Climate performs a maintainability analysis and Travis does a build and sends the coverage report to Coveralls. Updates will be seen in the shields in the `README.md` and details can be found on the reports at each service's site.

### Code coverage and unit testing

Testing is primarily done through Jest. Some example tests are included for `src/sketch.js` in `src/sketch.test.js`. Tests should be added throughout activity development. Tests can be run by:

```
npm run test
```

### Linting

ESLint is used for linting, which does code style checks and looks for potential errors. The linting process is integrated with webpack, which handles the asset bundling and build process. That process is discussed above, but the result is that linting does not need to be done explicitly. However, if that is necessary or even desirable, you can use the following to lint files within the `src` directory:

```
npx eslint src/
```

## Deployment

To prepare for activity deployment, the `index.html` and `bundle.js` in `./dist` should be placed in the
same directory. They can be served by any standard webserver or
`index.html` can be opened by a browser using `File > Open File...`.
